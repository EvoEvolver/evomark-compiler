{"d17f5bda55068c941ad13fd02d71830d":"\n\n10=2*5 is an equation.","7f5e8c266ddbf9e0deef5d88ffc9994a":"\n\n10 is a number and it is equal to two times five. That means if we multiply two by five we will get 10. So 2 times 5 is equal to 10.","9724a3cccb0d53ac1f23bc9b8ec46e49":"\n\n10 is an important number and it takes two sets of five to make it! So if we have 5 apples and someone gives us another 5 apples, we now have 10 apples! That's how the formula 10=2*5 works.","93bcb38de31a9523eff01164919e622b":"\n\nThis is an equation which means that if we add 5 and 5 together, we get 10. So, we can say that if we add five objects of something together, then we have a total of 10. For example, if we add five apples, we end up with a total of 10 apples."}
